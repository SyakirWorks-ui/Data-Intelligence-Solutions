# IBM HR Analytics: Workforce Insights & Attrition Automation

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of human resource metrics to identify patterns in employee performance, engagement, and attrition. By leveraging data-driven insights and a robust Python-based automation pipeline, this analysis aims to support HR departments in making strategic decisions to improve employee retention and workforce productivity.

## 📌 Project Overview
The core objective of this analysis is to explore the factors influencing employee turnover and performance. This includes analyzing salary distributions, department-specific trends, and the critical correlation between employee satisfaction, overtime work, and retention rates.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The project is organized into modular directories to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the analysis:

* **dashboard/**: Contains the final interactive Power BI dashboard (`.pbix`) with multi-page analytics including Executive Overview and Performance Analysis.
* **data/**: Divided into `raw/` for the original IBM dataset and `processed/` for the cleaned versions used in the final analysis.
* **docs/**: The professional reporting layer containing:
    * `images/`: High-resolution dashboard captures for quick stakeholder review.
    * `reports/`: Documented executive summaries and PDF analysis.
